# LOGIC PROJECT OF VNU-HCMUS CS14003 CLASS 22CLC04
## Project overview
- In this project, we are required to complete two problem in the file ```LogicProject.pdf```. According to the requirements, knowledge will be represented in form of propostional logic in problem 1 and first-order logic in problem 2.

## Problem statement
Given a knowledge base (KB) and a sentence α, both represented in propositional logic and normalized to CNF form. Determine whether KB entails α using resolution.
Report at least 5 test scenarios to demonstrate the program's validity (and hence scenarios should not be too simplistic). Provide a brief evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the resolution algorithm in propositional logic, as well as propose solutions to overcome the issues.
